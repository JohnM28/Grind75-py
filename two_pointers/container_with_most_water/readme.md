# Statement

You’re given an integer array height of length nn, and there are nn vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ithith line are (i,0)(i,0) and (ii, height[i]).

Find two lines from the input array that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds as much water as possible. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

    Note: You may not slant the container.

Constraints:

    n=n= height.length

    2≤2≤ nn ≤103≤103

    0≤0≤ height[i] ≤103≤103
